** Advantage of Quantum Channel  cite:Kimble2008
   - Quantum Channel provides exponential increase in computational dimension
   - $k 2^n$ to $2^{kn}$ when we connect k n-bit quantum nodes
   - Help to alleviate scaling and error-correlation problem
   - Simulation of evolution of quantum many-body system
   - "Spin-Spin" interaction of atoms simulated by quantum channel
   - Help to solve the problem of percolation
   - I.e can the liquid flow from the top of a cube to the bottom. When the cube has a cheese (Tom
     and Jerry type of cheese)like internal structure but some of the paths are blocked with
     probability p. [fn:1]
** Focus of this presentation: Quantum Channel
   - Coupling of single photons and atoms w/ help of cavity QED
   - Difficulty arises b/c photon-photon interaction cross-sections are tiny, i.e very unlikely to occur
   - Quantum Information processing with atomic ensemble
* Cavity QED: Quick and Dirty
* Application: Single-Photon Generation
* DLCZ protocol
* To the general case
* Quantum Repeater
  - Your Input needed
  - Ben and Chase plz help
* Conclusion: Challenges and Outlooks
