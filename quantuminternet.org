** Advantages of a Quantum Channel  cite:Kimble2008
   - A Quantum Channel provides an exponential increase in computational dimension
      - $k 2^n$ to $2^{kn}$ when we connect k n-bit quantum nodes
   - Helps to alleviate scaling and error-correlation problems
      - Simulation of evolution of quantum many-body systems
      - "Spin-Spin" interaction of atoms simulated by a quantum channel
      - Percolation problem
** Percolation sidenote
   - I.e., can the liquid flow from the top of a cube to the bottom? When the cube has a Swiss cheese
     like internal structure but some of the paths are blocked with
     probability $p$[fn:1]. 
** Focus of This Presentation: Quantum Channels
   - Transmission of photons
   - Use of atoms to store quantum states
   - Coupling of a single photon and an atom w/ help of cavity QED (Quantum Electrodynamics)
   - Photon-photon interaction cross-sections are tiny, i.e., very unlikely to occur
   - Quantum Information processing with atomic ensembles
** Requirements for Physical Realization cite:Kimble2008
*** Points                                                            :BMCOL:

    :END:
   - Interaction between light and matter should be easily tunable
   - Done through an interaction Hamiltonian $<H_{int}(t)> \approx \hbar \chi(t)$
   - Physical processes that controls $\chi(t)$ need to be robust in the face of imperfections (by adibatic transfer)
   - Mistakes can be efficiently detected and fixed (with quantum error correction)
   - Mathematically : $\chi >> \kappa >> \gamma$

   Fabry-Perot cavity
* Cavity QED: Quick and Dirty
** Terms[fn:2] cite:Kimble2008
   - $V_m$: mode volume, approximately the volume of resonator, defines spatial
     confinement. *Debated definition*
   - Quality factor: roughly defines how long the light lives in the cavity
   - $\vec{\epsilon}$: polarization vector
   - $\vec{\mu_0}$: transition dipole moment: how strong does the atom feel a EM wave with certain
     polarization?
   - $g = \sqrt{\frac{|\vec{\epsilon}\cdot \vec{\mu_0}|^2 \omega_C}{2\hbar \epsilon_0 V_m}}$
   - $\gamma$: atomic decay rate to modes other than the cavity mode
   - $\kappa$: decay rate of cavity mode
   - $n_0 \approx \gamma^2/g^2$: photons required to saturate the intracavity atom
   - $N_0 \approx \kappa \gamma /g^2$: number of atoms required to have an appreciable effect on
     intracavity field

** Strong Coupling Regime cite:Kimble2008
   - Requires $(N_0,n_0) << 1$
   - Could be achieved in the microwave domain with a Rydberg atom and a high Q superconducting cavity
   - In the optical domain: uses a high-finesse optical resonator, and atomic transitions with large
     $\vec{\mu_0}$ [fn:3]
   - Better confinement of the atoms will also help by reducing $V_m$

* Application: Reversable Single-Photon Generation on Demand
** How We Send Bits Classically
   - OK, it's a diagress, watch yourself if interested
   - Basically explains why we want a single photon to be sent
   - Classically, we send a bunch of them to represent a classical bit

** How We Do It
   
   - Mathematically $\ket{a}\ket{0} \leftrightarrow \ket{b}\ket{1}$
   - Notation is $\ket{\psi_{atom}} \ket{\phi_{Fock}}$
   - Dark State $\ket{D} = cos\theta\ket{a}\ket{0} + sin\theta\ket{b}\ket{1}$
   - $cos\theta = [1+\frac{\Omega(t)^2}{g^2}]^{-1/2}$
   - Need to modify $\Omega(t)$ adibatically, to coherently map the atomic state to the photon's state (and vice versa)
   - Intermediate transition $\ket{b} \rightarrow \ket{e}$ stongly coupled to a mode of optical cavity of
     energy $\hbar g$
 
     
** Importance
*** Importance                                                             :BMCOL:

    - Could serve as Quantum Memory
    - Optical field as a superposition of 0 and 1 Fock state sent through fiber
    - Use the control field $\Omega(t)$ to store the superposition information into the atoms

** Extended Entanglement cite:Kimble2008
   - Allows the control field to have different polarization over time
   - May entangle the state of atom with the polarization state of a flying photon, $p_1$
   - $p_1$ is not emitted by the atom, just entangling it with the atom. However, could have came
     from the emission process of another atom, thus having the state info of that atom.
   - Apply another control field to disentangle the atom with $p_1$ and emit another photon $p_2$
     which is in turn entangled with $p_1$
   % - No pics :(, the source file does not allow access, darn
* DLCZ protocol
** What Is It?
   - Protocol to distribute coherence and entanglement in the discrete variable regime.
   - $\ket{\phi_{a,1}} = \ket{0_a} \ket{0_1} + e^{i\beta} \sqrt{p}\ket{1_a}\ket{1_1} +\mathcal{O}(p)$
   - $\ket{1_a} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_a}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \ket{g_1} ... \ket{s_i} ... \ket{g_{N_a}}$
   - Note: the sharing of this 'spin up' property gives entanglement amongst all $N_a$ qubits

   - Combine the two ensembles of entangled atoms
   - $\ket{\Psi_{L,R}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ \ket{0_a}_L \ket{1_a}_R \pm e^{i\eta_1} \ket{1_a}_L
     \ket{0_a}_R]$
   - Resilient to important sources of imperfections and loses in propagation and detection
   - Creation of entanglement through measurement

** Extending Entanglement for Quantum Networks
   - Network of quantum nodes need not and should not be bipartite.
   - How to create entanglement among N quantum nodes?
   - How do we verify and quantify and entanglement between N parties?
   - Is "does it work for a certain algorithm" a good criterium?

* Conclusion: Challenges and Outlooks
** Outlooks
   - New developments in how to make quantum channels and other parts more robust
** Challenges 
   - Quantification of entanglement between many entities
   - Concurrence, negativity, and entropy of entanglement
